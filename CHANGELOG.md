## [2.2.0] - 2020-08-07

### Updates

- Act VII - new dimension: Tofu World! Explore this dimension after you've finished the Midnight... Wait, could this cute dimension be the source of all evil? Don't be deceived by the adorable creatures, they will try to kill you! Get to the Tofu World by making tofu. Grill the tofu and create a portal. You'll also need soy milk as well as a tofu stick (all explained in quest log). You can only craft the tofu stick once you've accessed the Midnight! Tofu World also brings about some new foods to try out!
- Enabled Tofu World compatibility with other mods, including crafting equipment.
- Added a new Act VII chapter in the quest log for Tofu World.
- Progression for The Bumblezone has been reduced from levels 10-18 to 14-18. This change is in part, due to performance issues. But I also find that the zone itself is a little barren at times.
- Modified some Bumblezone quest requirements to be easier/shorter.
- You are now expected to stay in the Overworld for longer. As a result, experience from OW quests has been increased by 50%.
- Added actual textures for all unique items (except bows)! Uniques will now also display their appropriate names.
- Added 4 new quests for mechanics that may be overlooked.
- Reduced efficiency of centrifuge, also changed its recipe to use honeycomb.
- High tier honeycomb variants are now harder to come by in The Bumblezone.
- Reduced vanilla mob health. I didn't notice Rough Mobs Revamped was effectively doubling the HP of some of the vanilla mobs... 80+ hp level 2 zombies are not cool.
- Reduced chance for vanilla mobs to spawn with equipment.
- Some general performance changes - should run a little smoother now (YMMV).
- Disabled feral wolves and lammer[...] from Better Animals Plus. It seems like trying to tame them still causes issues even though I thought I disabled taming.
- Reduced tarantula spawns from Better Animals Plus. They were just so, so many.

### Mod Changes
- Updated to Forge 31.2.36.
- Updated MineColonies, Immersive Engineering, Xaero's, Performant, Sound Filters.
- Added TofuCraftReload.
- Added Cull Particles - only render particles that are visible.
- Added Random Patches.
- Added Dynamic View - server side dynamic chunk viewer.
- Added Copy-Paste - no longer need to manually update your server configs!
- Removed It's The Little Things since Random Patches offers similar functionality.
- Removed Advanced Skin Customization - causing a few GUI glitches and isn't the most important mod to have for now. Might make a return in the future.

### Fixes
- Mine and Slash uniques compendium can be viewed without crashing now!
- Fixed wording on some quests.
- Fixed up some bow uniques.
